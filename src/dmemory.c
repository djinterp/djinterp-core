d_memcpy
  Cross-platform memory copy function that safely copies bytes from source
to destination buffer.

Parameter(s):
  _destination: pointer to the destination buffer where data will be copied.
  _source:      pointer to the source buffer containing data to copy.
  _count:       number of bytes to copy from source to destination.

Return:
  A pointer value corresponding to either:
  - _destination, if the copy operation was successful, or
  - NULL, if any of the following conditions were true:
    - _destination was NULL,
    - _source was NULL.
